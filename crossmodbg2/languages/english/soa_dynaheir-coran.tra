@0    = ~Ah, powerful Dynaheir, I've always thought that someone like you needs a sensitive heart. It can be quite... exposing, though.~
@1    = ~I hope you haven't suffered much because of it.~
@2    = ~No. I have not. Luckily, I am a witch that can protect herself; one that doth not fear to name a doubtful behavior when such is aimed at me.~
@3    = ~But thou wouldst not want to behave in an inappropriate way towards someone like myself, hmm?~
@4    = ~Me? Ha! Of course not. I do adore you, Dynaheir, you know that, but I suppose it would make things somewhat... complicated.~
@5    = ~Good. I'm glad we understand each other, Coran.~
