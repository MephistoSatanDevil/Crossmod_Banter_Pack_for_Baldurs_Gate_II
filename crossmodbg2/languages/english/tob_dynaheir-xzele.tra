@0    = ~Do you think I would be welcome in Rashemen? As... who I am.~
@1    = ~Rashemen is a place where we understand the dead also deserve respect. So, mayhap there would be those happy to welcome thee, our deathly paladin.~
@2    = ~...but there would also be those, that would see thee as a threat. Thou wouldst still need to convince those that thou meanst no harm.~
@3    = ~I suppose I could do that. And then, I would need to trust them, in return, that they would not try to bind me, or destroy me.~
@4    = ~Trust may be the key element, yes.~
