@0    = ~Ye must be damn furies inside, knowin' a Zhentarim like meself is shapin' the future of the realms, alongside a knighty like yerself! Har har!~
@1    = ~It is <CHARNAME> who has the greatest influence here, it is <PRO_HESHE> who's the one we both follow.~
@2    = ~I can only trust <PRO_HESHE> is going to make the right choices, not a thug, or anyone as vile as yourself, Montaron.~
@3    = ~I can't wait to see yer face when ye realize <CHARNAME> ain't stupid, and <PRO_HESHE> can actually get a lot by playin' the right cards.~
@4    = ~Ajantis! Tell me something: let's say a necromancer could change you, provide you with the power of undeath, make you stronger, and you would still be able to serve your stupid Most Noble Order of—Blah-Blah Something—would you accept such an offer?~
@5    = ~What? Of course not! This is a price I would never pay, and it stands against everything I swore to protect. I would no longer be Ajantis Ilvastarr.~
@6    = ~Hmm. A pity. Well, it is all very theoretical, but I wondered if you'd be smart enough to accept the gift, but no. You're not!~
@7    = ~This is truly saddening, but it is how they say: you cannot teach a skeletal dog new tricks!~
