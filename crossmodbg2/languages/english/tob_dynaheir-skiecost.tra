@1    = ~Yes, I had guessed as much, Skie. I suppose Jannath hath ever seemed right steadfast.~
@2    = ~Yeah, I suppose she's alright. But I think that you are stronger now. We did all these things, we saved all these people, and—I supppse we also robbed some bad guys.~
@3    = ~I suppose we did. But I shall always suggest to use those resources to help those they harmed. 'Tis only fair.~
@4    = ~Sure, I totally agree. Well, maybe we should just keep some small fee for doing all these good things, we still need food, and arrows, and maybe some new blankets, and—you know, things.~
@5    = ~Hmm. I suppose I shall allow that.~
